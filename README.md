Title: RISC-V Processor - Minor Project (Team of 3)

Description: This repository contains the code and documentation for our minor project on the RISC-V processor at RV College of Engineering, completed by a team of 3. The project is focused on designing pipelined RISC-V processors using Verilog HDL.

The repository includes the following files:

-> Verilog HDL source files for the processor. -> Testbench files for verifying the functionality of the processo. -> Documentation describing the design and implementation of the processor, including block diagrams, timing diagrams, and explanations of key components. -> Sample programs written in RISC-V assembly code to test the processor's functionality. -> A README file with instructions for building and testing the processor.

The project is intended to provide a hands-on learning experience in processor design and computer architecture, and was completed as part of our 6th semester coursework. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
